And are children being helped to understand the nature of artistic expression and to use media in more meaningful ways from an artistic point of view ? When these latter questions can be answered affirmatively , then we are providing children with educationally worthwhile art experiences in their early childhood education programs . ||||| 1993 ||||| nf ||||| 746761\"\n",
