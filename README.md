# Lexical Semantic Change Evaluation Framework

This repository contains the source code for evaluating dimensions of lexical semantic change concurrently, as outlined in the companion manuscript titled "A Multidimensional Framework for Evaluating Lexical Semantic Change with Social Science Applications" by Naomi Baes, Nick Haslam, and Ekaterina Vylomova.

## About

This framework evaluates lexical semantic change across various dimensions and supports analysis in Bash, Python, and R. Each dimension currently contains its own folder.

### Languages and Environments

- **Bash**: Shell scripts (.sh)
- **Python**: Scripts (.py) and Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
- **R**: Scripts (.R)

Environments:

- **Spartan**: Utilizes the University of Melbourneâ€™s hybrid high-performance computing system for preprocessing corpus data for corpus pre-processing (transformer models).
    - **Related Scripts**: Vim Editor and Slurm for HPC clusters.
- **Visual Studio Code IDE**: Integrated environment for running scripts with Conda environment management for Python and renv for R.
