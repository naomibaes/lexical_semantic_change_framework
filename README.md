## üìÑ About

**SIBling** proposes a unified, psychologically grounded framework for evaluating lexical semantic change (LSC) along three interpretable and quantifiable dimensions:

- **Sentiment**: positive ‚Üî negative  
- **Intensity**: strong ‚Üî weak  
- **Breadth**: wide ‚Üî narrow  

This framework reduces traditional lexical change types (e.g., amelioration, narrowing) into three continuous, empirically testable axes‚Äîenabling concurrent evaluation of how word meanings shifts over time.

## üü¢ üî¥ üîµ Dimensions of Change

| Dimension   | Definition | Rising Example | Falling Example |
|-------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| üü¢ **Sentiment** | Change in a word‚Äôs evaluative connotation: does it acquire more positive (*elevation*) or negative (*pejoration*) meaning? | *geek* (derogatory ‚Üí enthusiast) | *retarded* (clinical ‚Üí pejorative) |
| üî¥ **Intensity** | Shift in emotional force: does the meaning become stronger (*meiosis*) or weaker (*hyperbole*)? | *hilarious* (from cheerful ‚Üí extreme laughter) | *trauma* (from brain injury ‚Üí mild adversity) |
| üîµ **Breadth** | Shift in semantic scope: does the meaning expand (*generalization*) or contract (*specialization*) its semantic range? | *cloud* (weather ‚Üí internet storage) | *meat* (any food ‚Üí animal flesh) |

These axes mirror affective and connotational dimensions validated in psychology and semantics (e.g., Valence‚ÄìArousal, Evaluation‚ÄìPotency).

## üß™ Methodological Foundations

SIBling maps six classical types of semantic change (e.g., amelioration, narrowing, hyperbole) to **three semantic dimensions**. This enables:

- **Concurrent quantification** of multiple kinds of change  
- **Greater sensitivity** to subtle, co-occurring shifts in word meaning  
- **Alignment with psychological theories** of concept representation and cultural change  

> See [Figure 1 and Table 1](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.76) in the ACL 2024 paper for full theoretical mapping.

## üõ†Ô∏è Languages and Environments

**Programming Languages**  
- **Python**: Language evaluation scripts (`*.py`, Jupyter Notebooks)  
- **R**: Mainly statistical analysis and plotting (`*.R`)  
- **Bash**: Shell scripts for preprocessing and job scheduling (`*.sh`)

**Computational Environments**  
- **Spartan (HPC)**: Used for large-scale preprocessing, embedding extraction, and SLURM-based job execution  
- **VS Code / Local IDEs**: Recommended for running Python and R scripts locally, using Conda (Python) and `renv` (R) for reproducibility

---

## üìé Additional Information

- - **Reproducibility**: The `environment.txt` file contains instructions and a Google Drive link to download the original `.conda/` and `renv/` folders used in the project. These ensure consistent environments for:
  - üêç **Python**: via Conda-managed environments
  - üìä **R**: via `renv`, enabling project-specific library management and reproducibility

> To restore the R environment:
> ```r
> install.packages("renv")
> renv::restore()
> ```
- **Future Updates**: This repository may be expanded to streamline processes or incorporate improved methods for evaluating each semantic dimension.

We present a three-dimensional framework for integrating these forms and a unified computational methodology for evaluating them concurrently. The dimensions represent increases or decreases in semantic 1) sentiment (valence of a target word{'}s collocates), 2) intensity (emotional arousal of collocates or the frequency of intensifiers), and 3) breadth (diversity of contexts in which the target word appears). These dimensions can be complemented by evaluation of shifts in the frequency of the target words and the thematic content of its collocates. This framework enables lexical semantic change to be mapped economically and systematically and has applications in computational social science. We present an illustrative analysis of semantic shifts in \textit{mental health} and \textit{mental illness} in two corpora, demonstrating patterns of semantic change that illuminate contemporary concerns about pathologization, stigma, and concept creep."
