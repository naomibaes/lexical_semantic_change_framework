## üìÑ About

**SIBling** proposes a unified, psychologically grounded framework for analyzing and categorizing lexical semantic change (LSC) along three interpretable and quantifiable dimensions:

- **Sentiment**: positive ‚Üî negative  
- **Intensity**: strong ‚Üî weak  
- **Breadth**: wide ‚Üî narrow  

This framework reduces traditional lexical change types (e.g., amelioration, narrowing) into three continuous, empirically testable axes‚Äîenabling concurrent evaluation of meaning shifts over time.

## üü¢ üî¥ üîµ Dimensions of Change

| Dimension   | Definition | Rising Example | Falling Example |
|-------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| üü¢ **Sentiment** | Change in a word‚Äôs evaluative connotation: does it acquire more positive (*elevation*) or negative (*pejoration*) meaning? | *geek* (derogatory ‚Üí enthusiast) | *retarded* (clinical ‚Üí pejorative) |
| üî¥ **Intensity** | Shift in emotional or referential force: does the meaning become stronger (*hyperbole*) or weaker (*meiosis*)? | *hilarious* (from cheerful ‚Üí extreme laughter) | *trauma* (from injury ‚Üí mild adversity) |
| üîµ **Breadth** | Shift in semantic scope: does the meaning expand (*generalization*) or contract (*specialization*)? | *cloud* (weather ‚Üí internet storage) | *meat* (any food ‚Üí animal flesh) |

These three axes mirror affective and connotational dimensions validated in psychology and semantics (e.g., Valence‚ÄìArousal, Evaluation‚ÄìPotency).

## üß™ Methodological Foundations

SIBling maps six classical types of semantic change (e.g., amelioration, narrowing, hyperbole) to **three orthogonal semantic dimensions**. This enables:

- **Concurrent quantification** of multiple kinds of change  
- **Greater sensitivity** to subtle, co-occurring shifts in word meaning  
- **Alignment with psychological theories** of concept representation and cultural change
