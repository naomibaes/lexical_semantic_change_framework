Description:

	- .conda/: Contains environment configuration files and dependencies managed by Conda, a package manager for Python.
	- renv/: Holds the environment configuration files and dependencies managed by renv, an R package manager for managing project-specific R environments. `renv` for consistent and isolated environments for each project (ensuring consistent package versions across different machines or user accounts).
            - *New Project?* Initialize `renv: renv::init()`
            - Ensure renv is installed: `install.packages("renv")`
            - Activate the environment: `renv::restore()`

These folders are crucial for managing the project's environment and ensuring reproducibility.
